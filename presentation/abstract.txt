Abstract

Whether they are going to work or to the airport, many New Yorkers rely on taxis to keep them moving. By understanding how these 
taxis move around the city, and looking closely at driver patterns on the road, we can gain
more insight into the overall robustness of NYC's taxi system. In our research, we used data from the NYC TLC to answer some
interesting questions. First, can we identify patterns in the flow of people around the city and how they vary across neighborhoods 
and time? Second, how does driver behavior vary, and are there patterns that successful drivers exhibit? Finally, can we use
information about driver behavior and patterns in flow to improve the taxi transportation system?
