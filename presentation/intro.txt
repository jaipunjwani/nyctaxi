A. Overview of taxi system (w/ gif in slide)
- Grab audience w/ prompt

B. 2013 Data Set 
#SLIDE: screenshots of the data frame
- The data we acquired contains all trips made my yellow cabs in 2013 (over 100 million rides!)
- For each ride, we have information such as the time, cost, trip distance, the coordinates (lat/long) of the pickup/dropoff, 
an anonymized license of the taxi, as well as an anomymized license of the driver
- We had the choice of working with taxi data from 2015, but 2013 was the most recent taxi data that contained anonymized driver 
licenses for each trip. Having these licenses allowed us to see all trips made my a particular driver, and helped us analyze driver
patterns (as we will talk about soon)


* For our research, we focused on the single month of July in 2013. We believe that July represents an average month in terms of flow
of yellow cabs in NYC (it contains a holiday - July 4th and regular days)
#solidify reasoning

C. Cleaning Up & Weirdness (Understanding our data more)
- coordinates off the globe #show picture of some weird coordinates?
- trips that started and ended in the same location 
{possibly roundtrip; broken meter; taxi driver didn't turn on meter; airport trip - flat fare charged, so driver didn't use meter}
- drivers who drove for short amounts of time, but charged the passenger a riduculous fee 
{possible reasons?: meter did not work; fare was negotiated; or something fishy is going on}

D. Research Questions (centered around analyzing efficiency for improvement)
1. Can we get understand traffic flow in the city?
2. Can we understand driver behavior and analyze how efficient they are?
3. Can we improve the taxi transportation system in NYC?

E. Transition into flow
